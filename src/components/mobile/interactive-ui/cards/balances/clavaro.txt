issues
1
when moving to a new page, radio group state is set to 'balance'
but the display is still clavero

this is because component state is set back to 'balance' on render
could wrap it in memo??
DOESNT WORK

set state to redux state on mount using use-effect?
or set redux state to component state on mount? // this i think


2 
records are not reset on page change
fixed i think

3
pay dues

4
question mark next to clavero and an explanation

5
pagination

6 
modal showing all balance sheets next to each other
