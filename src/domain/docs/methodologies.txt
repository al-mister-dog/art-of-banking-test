 For example, assume that on a given day, 
 $10 billion of federal funds transactions occurred at each of 5, 10, 15 and 20 basis points, 
 and $60 billion occurred at 25 basis points. 
 This represents $100 billion of total volume. 
 The median would be the rate at the ‘middle dollar’, 
 or $50 billion, which is 25 basis points in this example. 
 
 Alternatively, if $20 billion of transactions occurred at 10, 15, 20 and 25 basis points, 
 the volume-weighted median would be 15 basis points.
