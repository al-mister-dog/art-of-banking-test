`In order to try reduce the risk involved in loan creations and overdrafts etc, various 
constraints may be put on banks, by the government or even the banks themselves. constraints
however are also naturally imposed, due to the dual role a bank plays as a profit making 
instution and a payments facilitator.`,
`Because cash is in many ways seen as the final form of settlement, a bank must ensure that
it can redeem its customers on a day to day basis. The surest way of doing this would be
to keep all the cash deposited in a vault, in case all the customers decide to all take out
their money at the same time. Of course, this is unlikely and the bank would like to use 
these funds for investments elsewhere. But bank-runs can and do happen.`,
`This then is one of many constraints a bank faces. Traditionally banks are required to keep
a fraction of total customer deposits as reserves. For example if total customer deposits were
$10000, a bank may be required by law to keep $2500 in reserve to meet its daily demands.`,
`We have seen by playing with overdrafts how credit can expand and contract. Credit expansion 
means there is lots of investment going on, and lots of payments being made. However this 
is a precarious position for a bank if suddenly everyone gets spooked and wants to redeem their
deposits as cash. On the other hand, if credit doesn't expand, growth becomes much slower or 
even impossible. The art of banking requires striking a balance between constraint and elasticity.`,
