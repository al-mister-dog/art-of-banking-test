      FUNDAMENTALS
      introduction
      [`If you have ever opened up a copy of the Financial Times you will most probably have been
      confronted with a lot of jargon words and confusing graphs. Terms like LDIs, bond yields 
      and interest-rate swaps may well leave you scratching your head. This isn't just some 
      made up language of course, but it is an obstacle for anyone trying to gain a better 
      understanding of how finance, economy, money and the world in general works. `
      ,
      `These lectures aim to guide you through the esoteric world of money and banking by 
      starting the journey somewhere familiar, the local bank. We will analyse the 
      balancesheet of a bank and the balancesheet of a customer, revealing what goes on
      behind the scenes of seemingly innocuous activities of depositing cash, making 
      transfers and running an overdraft.`
      ,
      `Later on we will build on the intuition gained in this chapter and apply it to
      activities that take place not between banks and customers, but banks and other 
      banks. You will begin to realise that a lot of the technical practices that are 
      the subject of Broad-Sheet papers are in fact not too different to the practices
      that take place between you and your local bank.`

      `Hopefuly by the end of the course you should be able to read through the Financial 
      Times without having to get the dictionary out.`]

      balancesheets and deposits
      `Whether you are a customer, a corporation, a bank or a government, you will have 
      in-comings and out-goings. You have things that you own and things that you owe. 
      In banking, the things you own are called assets, and the things that you owe to
      others are called liabilities. If we take the example of a bank and customer, what 
      are their assets and liabilities?`,
      `A customer will most commonly have two types of assets. These are cash reserves and 
      deposits. We could say that the customer's cash reserves include the money in their wallet
      or any other cash to hand. They can use this money instantly to buy things like groceries etc.
      Deposits are money that a customer has in a bank, and these are also assets. There are however
      some key differences between deposits and cash. `,
      `Rather than being actual cash, deposits represent a promise by your bank to pay you cash.
      When you deposit your cash at the bank, that cash belongs to the bank, and they could spend
      it if they wished. What they give you in return is a claim on the bank, in cash, for the 
      amount of deposits you have in your account. This may seem a little pedantic, but these 
      small differences are crucial to understand as we begin to follow the many paths that money
      takes.`,
      `Deposits are an asset of the customer, yet at the same time they are a liability of the bank.
      For a bank, deposits represent the money that the bank owes you at any time, on demand. 
      It useful to remember that "a customer's asset is a bank's liability". This is a principal of
      double-entry bookkeeping. The cash that was given to the bank in exchange for deposits is an
      asset of the bank. And it is useful to bear in mind that there are far more deposits than there
      is cash in circulation. If every customer at a branch wanted to redeem their deposits in cash, 
      the bank would not have the reserves to do so. This is an aspect of "fractional reserve banking",
      which in these lectures, is taken as a key feature of banking.`
