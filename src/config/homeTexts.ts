        the late 19th and early 20th century, and explore the conditions that led to the creation
        of the United States Federal Reserve. On the way we will try out the various systems of banking
        that existed in this period, including the Wild Cat era, Corresponding Banking and an early prototype
        of the Fed known as Clearing House banking.

        the national payments system in America up until the financial crisis of 2008. We will uncover
        how money is 'created' by the Fed to facilitate day-to-day payments between banks, how the Fed 
        keeps the reigns on credit from expanding too far, and how other private banks act as 'dealers',
        becoming a facilitator between other banks in making payments.
